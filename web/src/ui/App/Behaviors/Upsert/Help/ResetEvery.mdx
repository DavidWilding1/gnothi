How often should this be done? Eg every day, week, month, year? The most typical is daily (and you can specify the days); but some tasks you may want to do weekly. I can't envision monthly or yearly; if you want to do taxes, you'll just create a one-off To-Do when the time comes; but hey, users can use this however they want.

`Forever` is a special case - it doesn't reset, and it doesn't accumulate scoring. It simply applies a static score value each use. The obvious case is rewards, where you cash in points for real-life rewards.
