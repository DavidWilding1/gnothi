Behaviors can be used for data-tracking, habit-tracking, or both. The 3 core types are `number`, `fivestar`, and `check`.

* `Number`: track *quantities*; like hours slept, glasses of water, medication milligrams, weight, etc.
* `Five-Star`: track *qualities*. Eg, rate aspects of your life like mood or productivity.
* `Check`: track *yes/no*; like taking medication, menstrual cycles, etc.
