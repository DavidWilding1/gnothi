Behaviors can be used for data-tracking, habit-tracking, or both. The 3 core types are `Number`, `Five-Star`, and `Check`. Mix-and-matching is advanced, so these templates help you get started.

* `Habit`: Track habits which count multiple times per day (either good or bad). Cigarettes, glasses of water, pushups, pomodoros, etc. Based on `Number`.
* `Daily`: Track things you want to do once per day (or a specific number per day); like going to the gym, taking your medication, etc. Based on `Check`.
* `Todo`: Track things you want to do once ever. Based on `check`.
* `Reward`: Track when you cash out on rewards, which you earned from points above. Based on `Number`.
* `Data`: Track things like sleep quality, mood, etc. Things which you shouldn't gain or lose points over; but you want insights. Defaults to `Five-Star` with only `Analyze` enabled (no scoring).

To give you a feel for why templates instead of hard-coded presets, there are more advanced possibilities, which you can configure yourself. For example, if you want a "multi-daily" - a daily you should do x amount per day - choose the `Daily` template, change it from `Check` to `Number`, and set a `Reset Quota`.
