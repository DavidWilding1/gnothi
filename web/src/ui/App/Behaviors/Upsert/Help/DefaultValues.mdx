When `Analyze` is enabled, you maybe find it valuable to autofill missing behavior data via rules. Machine learning (ML) algorithms work better with more data; so if there's a rule-of-thumb for days where you forgot to visit Gnothi, it makes life easier on the algorithms. This isn't required, ML *can* work with missing data; it just may be less informative. The options are:
* `Value` (recommended). Enter a specific default value with which Gnothi populates missing day. Eg, if you're tracking alcohol, it might make sense to autofill 0 (no drinks) any time you didn't come here to specify otherwise. Use this option if you're unsure.
* `Yeterday's value` (aka "forward-fill"). Pulls from the last-known entry whenever there's blanks. Eg, when tracking medication in milligrams, you might enter a hard-coded `20`, which is safe to assume is always the case unless you up your dosage. Then if you change your dosage, you can enter it once and all future dates will use that change.
* `Average`. Calculates the average of all entries for this behavior. Good for things like mood, productivity scores, etc.

The default option `Value`, and the default value is nothing/blank (which is different than 0). As stated, ML works best with actual values; but it *can* work with missing data. Since there's no easy guess as to how you'll use this behavior, the safest bet on *our* side is this configuration. In fact, since ML *can* work with missing data, empty values can be meaningful. Eg, if you didn't track your mood, that actually may mean something different than a good or bad mood; maybe it means you're off the horse, and that's noteable to Gnothi.
