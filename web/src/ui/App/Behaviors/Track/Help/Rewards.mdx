Rewards are things you spend your points on. Unlike RPG-gamified habit-trackers, Gnothi wants you to spend your points only on real-life rewards. Video games, TV, books, etc. Turn that guilty pleasure into just a pleasure (and a hard-earned one at that). Vegetables before dessert. Trading points for rewards helps you keep structure, while preventing burnout. Use these liberally! Your points will disappear over time, so you want to cash them out fast.
