Habits are things you do any number per day, both positive and negative. Negative habits include each cigarette, beer, nail-biting, social media session, etc. Positive habits include each drink of water, push-up session, thought reframe, etc. Unlike dailies, these are for tracking each occurrence, without concern for a quota. It will take some thinking, but you'll find that there's a clear distinction between habits and dailies. Dailies you want to achieve specifically x times per day. Habits you just want to track if/when you do them.

The distinction between habits and rewards is a bit tricky. Eg, should a beer count as a bad habit, or a reward? The rule-of-thumb is: if it negatively impacts your life, it's a bad habit. However, if (in moderation) it enriches your life, even if it's a guilty pleasure (video games, movies) - it's a reward. Alcohol is an example of a personal distinction.
