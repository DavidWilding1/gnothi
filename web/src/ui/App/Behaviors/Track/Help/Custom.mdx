Custom behaviors are what separates Gnothi from things like Habitica. Not all tracking is habit-tracking. There are miscellaneous points of data you may want to track which don't earn points. Things like your weight, medication dosage, menstruation cycle, number of drinks the night before, hours of sleep, etc. Quantitative and qualitative data which you want used in behavioral analysis. This is also a good segue into the Analyze tab above. All data on this page (habits, dailies, todos, custom, and rewards) will be used by Gnothi to determine which behaviors are impacting other behaviors. Eg, when analyzing sleep quality (a Custom behavior), you may see alcohol (habit) and exercise (daily) at the top.
