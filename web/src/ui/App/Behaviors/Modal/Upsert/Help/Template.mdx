Behaviors can be used for data-tracking, habit-tracking, or both. The 3 core types are `number`, `fivestar`, and `check`. Mix-and-matching is advanced, so these templates help you get started.

* `Data`: defaults to `fivestar` with only `Analyze` enabled (no scoring). Use this for things like sleep quality, mood, etc. Things which you shouldn't gain or lose points over; but you want insights.
* `Habit`: based on `number`, track habits which count multiple times per day (either good or bad). Cigarettes, glasses of water, pushups, pomodoros, etc.
* `Daily`: based on `check`, track things you want to do once per day (or a specific number per day); like going to the gym, taking your medication, etc.
* `Todo`: based on `check`, track things you want to do once ever.
* `Reward`: based on `number`: track when you cash out on rewards, which you earned from points above.
