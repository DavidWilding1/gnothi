Behaviors can be used for data-tracking, habit-tracking, or both. The 3 core types are `number`, `fivestar`, and `check`. Everything else is a "template" which combines these core types with advanced attributes.

* `Number`: track *quantities*; like hours slept, glasses of water, medication milligrams, weight, etc.
* `Five-Star`: track *qualities*. Eg, rate aspects of your life like mood or productivity.
* `Check`: track *yes/no*; like taking medication, menstrual cycles, etc.

You'll use the above to track raw data for analysis. If you also want to gamify habit-tracking - using a points-based system (rewards and punishment) - then you can select from additional templates. These templates are nothing more than the above types, but with certain advanced attributes set (eg enabling points and reset periods).

* `Habit`: based on `number`, track habits which count multiple times per day (either good or bad). Cigarettes, glasses of water, pushups, pomodoros, etc.
* `Daily`: based on `check`, track things you want to do once per day (or a specific number per day); like going to the gym, taking your medication, etc.
* `Todo`: based on `check`, track things you want to do once ever.
* `Reward`: based on `number`: track when you cash out on rewards, which you earned from points above.
